# Hospital prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms 

This project consists of the ability to predict hospital patient residence periods and admission type, the possibility of having heart failure or coronary artery disease, and the ability to predict glucose and hemoglobin levels.

The importance of this research lies in determining the suitable features of blood tests, diseases, activities, age, gender, etc.. needed to predict each label and to provide hospital staff with a meaningful tool that provides insight on determining the possibility of having the diseases, specific blood tests levels illustrated above and how long should a patient stay at the hospital or deciding their admission type. With further studies, this research can also provide insight into the resources needed for each patient and more accurate predictions with multiple datasets.

ML Algorithms used: 
1 - Duration of Stay: Dummy Regressor, Linear Regression, and Random Forest
     Regressor.
     
2 - Heart Failure: Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and Dense 
      Neural Networks.
      
3 - Glucose: Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regression, and
      Logistic XGBoost. 
      
4 - Hemoglobin: Random Forest Regressor and Logistic XGBoost. 

5 - Patients Type of Admission: Support Vector Classifier, Binary Hinge
     XGBoost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. 
     
6 - Coronary Artery Disease: Dense Neural Network, Random Forest
      Classifier, and Binary Hinge XGBoost.
